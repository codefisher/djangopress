# django-Press

django-Press is a set of django applications that is intended to cover all of the basic applications that are needed to build a web site.  It goal is to be to web masters, what django is to web developers.

Each application is supposed to be loosely coupled, so that they can be used on their own, but may also do extra things when they are together.

Currently there are applications for:

  * CMS
  * Forum
  * Blog
  * Contact Page
  * Accounts
  
We plan to add
  
  * Private Messaging
  * Themes
  * File Uploads
  * Polls
  * Wiki
  
django-Press is never intended to have have the best any of these types of applications.  But solid basic versions, that work together nicely.  

It should currently be considered alpha, but is being used on and developed for [Codefisher.org](https://codefisher.org/)
