<h2>Donating</h2>

<p>
 Donations support my continued efforts to create quality add-ons, icons and other content.  It covers in part the the costs and time spent working on my software.  I do what I do because of the pleasure and satisfaction I receive from it.  But receiveing something in return makes in even more worth while, so I ask you to donate and be generious to this university student.
